                <p>In this book about the deep sea’s elaborate ecosystems, marine biologist Helen Scales highlights the wild fact that the deep sea is a realm we know less about than the moon! When we think about the sea, most of our attention is paid to areas like the ocean’s surface and coastlines. But thriving in the deepest corners of our ocean is a treasure-trove of interconnected ecosystems teeming with life forms we may never have expected … Yet, these seemingly far-removed systems have a massive impact on our daily lives, especially when it comes to climate and weather.</p>

                <p>Below the Edge of Darkness by Edith Widder, Ph.D. If you’re fascinated by the ability of certain organisms to thrive in the darkest areas of the deepest parts of our ocean, look no further than this captivating documentation of bioluminescence. Below the Edge of Darkness was written by Edith Widder, a marine biologist who became fascinated by the power of light after experiencing temporary blindness due to surgery complications. This book takes readers on a journey 800 feet below the surface to explore some of the biggest modern questions about the deep sea, as well as the risks of modern exploration and their implications for the future health of our ocean.

                <p>The earth's oceans hold many wondrous surprises-be they the small, colorful critters off the coast of Papua New Guinea, opportunistic red demon squids in the Sea of Cortes, or naval wrecks in the lagoon of Bikini Atoll. In Fifty Places to Dive Before You Die, Chris Santella has invited diving experts from around the world to share some of their favorite destinations, so ardent divers can experience these underwater wonders for themselves-either on location in their SCUBA gear, or at home in their armchair.</p>

                <p>The novel written by Nick Pyenson is all about whales. Whales are among the largest, most intelligent, deepest diving species to have ever lived on our planet. They evolved from land-roaming, dog-sized creatures into animals that move like fish, breathe like us, can grow to 300,000 pounds, live 200 years and travel entire ocean basins. Whales fill us with terror, awe, and affection--yet there is still so much we don't know about them. Why did it take whales over 50 million years to evolve to such big sizes, and how do they eat enough to stay that big? And many more about Whalesare mensioned in this novel. </p>

                <p>Treasure, Obsession, and the Search for a Legendary Pirate Ship is a New York Times best-selling non-fiction book by Robert Kurson recounting the discovery of the pirate ship the Golden Fleece by two American divers, John Chatterton and John Mattera, in Samaná Bay off the north coast of the Dominican Republic in 2008.[1] Until Chatterton and Mattera discovered the resting place of the Golden Fleece, Joseph Bannister's success as a pirate had little modern evidence.</p>

                <p>In The Empty Ocean, acclaimed author and artist Richard Ellis tells the story of our continued plunder of life in the sea and weighs the chances for its recovery. Through fascinating portraits of a wide array of creatures, he introduces us to the many forms of sea life that humans have fished, hunted, and collected over the centuries, from charismatic whales and dolphins to the lowly menhaden, from sea turtles to cod, tuna, and coral.Rich in history, anecdote, and surprising fact, Richard Ellis's descriptions bring to life the natural history of the various species, the threats they face, and the losses they have suffered. </p>

                <p>In Why Fish Don’t Exist, Lulu Miller details the work of taxonomist David Starr Jordan, a man who is now credited with discovering close to one-fifth of all fish species known to humans at the time. After natural occurrences like lightning and fire ruined many of his samples, a California earthquake in the early 1900s demolished his specimen collection. But Jordan refused to let his work be lost to the rubble. He examined the wreckage and slowly rebuilt his collection from the specimens he recognized and created a new tool to protect his collections from similar damage in the future. Author and NPR reporter, Lulu Miller takes us on the wild adventure of her research about Jordan’s life … and let’s just say that if you like twists and turns, you won’t be left hanging with this read!</p>

                <p>In pursuit of the wild, solitary, predatory octopus, popular naturalist Sy Montgomery has practiced true immersion journalism. From New England aquarium tanks to the reefs of French Polynesia and the Gulf of Mexico, she has befriended octopuses with strikingly different personalities—gentle Athena, assertive Octavia, curious Kali, and joyful Karma. Each creature shows her cleverness in myriad ways: escaping enclosures like an orangutan; jetting water to bounce balls; and endlessly tricking companions with multiple “sleights of hand” to get food.

                    Scientists have only recently accepted the intelligence of dogs, birds, and chimpanzees but now are watching octopuses solve problems and are trying to decipher the meaning of the animal’s color-changing techniques. </p>
