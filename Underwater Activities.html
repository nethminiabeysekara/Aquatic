                <h2>Whale Watching Tour</h2>
                <p>One of the most spectacular things to do in Sri Lanka is to watch the magnanimous whales in their natural habitat, making it one of the sought-after water sports in Sri Lanka. Mirissa is the place to go if you want to watch some mind-boggling whale show. The tour starts in the morning, which will take you out into the sea to watch the whales. Keep an eye out for some local fishermen as well. You may also be served breakfast on your whale-watching tour.</p>

                <h2>Underwater Photography</h2>
                <p>Underwater photography is an expedition you would want to indulge in, mainly if photography is your thing. The good news is that the underwater world — especially the shallow seas — has a lot to marvel over.

                    It would help if you had a proficient waterproof camera and, of course, the gear to keep you underwater for as long as you want. Most cameras, including GoPros, are the most sought-after for underwater photography since they have the propensity to operate without getting faulty.</p>

                <h2>Sailing in Sri Lanka</h2>
                <p>You can hire your own chartered boat and sail away through the sea and enjoy the scenery across Bentota and Burwela. Mirissa is also a famous spot for water sports in Sri Lanka. The journey usually starts around 9:00 am and is approximately a three-hour tour. The boat also takes a detour from a wonderful cove where you can jump into the water or go snorkeling and paddle boarding.</p>

                <h2>Cliff Diving</h2>
                <p>If you love being in the water - but do not feel that simply swimming or diving gives you an adrenaline rush you are after - cliff diving might be right up your alley.  

                    It is daring, thrilling, and, quite frankly, awe-inspiring. And for a moment there, you wll get a chance to feel as if you are actually flying - before plunging into the water. 
                    
                    There is nothing quite like it, and the rush you get is insane. 
                    
                    Cliff diving is certainly not for the faint-hearted. But if you are into extreme sports, you wll be glad to know that you do not need much to get started. There is no specialized equipment, either. It is just you, a body of water, and a natural feature, like a cliff, to take the leap from; that is it. </p>

                <h2>Freediving</h2>
                <p>Freediving, a captivating aquatic discipline, embodies the art of exploring the depths on a single breath. It transcends mere sport, delving into the realm of personal challenge and connection with the ocean's mysteries. Stripped of cumbersome gear, freedivers plunge into the cerulean abyss, where time seems suspended, and the senses sharpen. Each descent becomes a dance with the water, a harmonious symphony of relaxation and focus. Amidst the tranquility of weightlessness, freedivers navigate with grace, embracing the primal rhythm of their own breath as they journey into the liquid unknown. In this realm of silence, they discover a profound communion with the sea, an intimate dialogue between body and element, where limits are tested and boundaries dissolved. </p>
