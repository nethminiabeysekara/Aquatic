        <h1>what are sea plants</h1>
        <p>Sea plants are a varied collection of organisms found in salty settings including oceans, seas, and estuaries.Ocean plants range from single-celled creatures to dense kelp forests, having evolved to survive in the aquatic environment. Invertebrates and fish rely on these plants as a major food source, and they also give surrounding marine life oxygen and serve as a haven and nursery for a variety of marine animals.</p>

        <p>Coral reefs are amazing undersea ecosystems that are dominated by reef-building corals. Coral reefs are the most diversified marine environment. They are teeming with life, with around one-quarter of all ocean species relying on reefs for food and shelter.</p>

They are widely distributed across the world's waters and perform critical roles in marine ecosystems. They are eukaryotic creatures with no vascular tissue (which transports water and other chemicals like as carbohydrates) or organized tissue. </p>

They are known as "red" algae because of their distinctive reddish hue, which is mostly produced by the presence of pigments like phycoerythrins and phycocyanins. </p>

The massive size, rapid growth rate, and sophisticated roles in marine ecosystems define kelp. In the best situations, some kelp species can attain a height of 150 feet . Kelp forests contribute to ocean flooring ecosystems’ diversity. Kelp grows along coastlines and enjoys cold waters.   </p>
